Write a Java program that takes two integers as input from the user and performs division, handling division by zero and invalid input types.
Create a Java program that reads from a user-specified file, implementing exception handling for file not found and I/O errors.
Create a class hierarchy for animals. Design a base class Animal with properties like name and age. Then, create two subclasses: Dog and Cat. Each subclass should have a method sound() that returns the sound the animal makes.
Design a class hierarchy for bank accounts. Create a base class BankAccount with properties like accountNumber and balance. Then, create two subclasses: SavingsAccount and CurrentAccount. Implement methods to deposit and withdraw money, and override a method to display account details specific to each account type.
Develop a class hierarchy for geometric shapes. Create a base class Shape with a method area(). Then, implement two subclasses: Circle and Rectangle. Each subclass should have a constructor to initialize its dimensions and override the area() method to calculate the area of the shape.
Implement a Java program demonstrating the use of abstract classes and interfaces in a banking application scenario. Define classes Account (abstract class), SavingsAccount, and CurrentAccount implementing different interfaces for operations like deposit, withdraw, and calculateInterest.
Implement a Java program to demonstrate multithreading using the Runnable interface for printing numbers 1 to 10 using two threads.
Write a Java program that creates two threads. The first thread should print numbers from 1 to 10 with a delay of 500 milliseconds between each number. The second thread should print the letters from 'A' to 'J' with a delay of 700 milliseconds between each letter. Use the Thread class to create the threads.
Create a Java program that uses multiple threads to increment a shared counter. Implement a class Counter with a synchronized method increment() that increases the counter by 1. Create three threads that each increment the counter 1000 times. After all threads finish, print the final value of the counter to ensure it is correct.
